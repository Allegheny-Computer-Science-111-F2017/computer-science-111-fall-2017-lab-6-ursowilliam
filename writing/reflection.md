# Reflection by Bill Urso

During the sixth labatory assignment many new and difficult challenges. In the
labatory assignment it was important to read in a set of DNA buy using the
string method. Then the first step was to find the complement of the string.
The reason for the excessive difficulty of this step was that if you just did a
normal replace then the computer would get confused. So this is were I had to
use some creativity. This step could be different for everyone writing the
program. The technique that I developed was to change the letters and use
.replace to change them to the compliment lowercase letters. After this step I
changed the letters to uppercase by using the .toUpperCase command to get the
letters back to their normal state.

The next challenge of the lab was to use something we learned in class during
the week, the random variable. By using the random technique this would produce
a random output when used. This was important to use when inserting a random
letter and deleting a random integer. This was hard to figure out as it was new
but after multiple attempts I was able to develop the right programming
techniques to accomplish this job. The random technique was an important thing
to learn as it is used by programmers in everyday work. I learned a lot of new
techniques in this lab that will be useful not just for class but in everyday
work.
